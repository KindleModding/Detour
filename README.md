# Detour 🛣️

> [!NOTE]
> Detour is NOT a jailbreak. It simply loads WAFs, and is backwards compatible with Mesquito. Stay tuned for UJ!

Detour is a mesquito/illusion-inspired persistent WAF loader that works on all non-MTP kindles up to 5.18.4. (MTP kindles before 5.18.1 are still supported).

It is based on an exploit discovered by hhhhhh.

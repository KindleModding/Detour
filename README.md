# Detour 🛣️

> [!NOTE]
> Detour is NOT a jailbreak. It simply loads WAFs, and is backwards compatible with Mesquito. Stay tuned for UJ!

Detour is a mesquito/illusion-inspired persistent WAF loader that works on all non-MTP kindles up to 5.18.4. (MTP kindles before 5.18.1 are still supported).

It is based on an exploit discovered by hhhhhh.

## How it works

1. You load in the Detour installer like how you used to load in Mesquito.
2. Detour changes the internal URL the store fetches to the one hosted at https://detour.penguins184.xyz/
3. Profit! You now have a persistent WAF loader.
4. To reverse this, press the 3 dots, and "Remove Detour".
